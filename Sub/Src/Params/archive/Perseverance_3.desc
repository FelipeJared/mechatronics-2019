Description of Referenced File:
    This file contains the parameters used in the testing of June 25, 2019. We adjusted
    the max and min errors for of the PID controllers to give smoother control. However,
    at this testing DVL still did not work (fixed by next testing) and we had to much
    latency receiving the remote control inputs.
